cp - short for "Competitive Programming".

I used to hate it back in college. But I am liking it now - lol :D

Some backstory:

I bought this book for my sister to prepare for IOI. But then she chose a different group (Physics, Chemistry, Maths, Biology) instead of (Physics, Chemistry, Maths, Computer Science).

So the book has been lying around for a while.

One day, I opened the book to read a few pages. BOOM! I am loved the energy.

So here I am, trying solve some programming challenges in my favorite programming language!
